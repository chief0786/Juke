## Overview

Juke serves as a convenient and user-friendly SDK for connecting your custom bots (trained and exported with GigaLearn) directly into Rocket League. With a simple configuration and injection step, you can operate your AI in-game with minimal effort.

---

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Prepare Your Bot

- Download/build your GigaLearn bot and locate its exported files.
- In the `Bot` folder provided with Juke, paste all necessary files from your bot (CRITIC.lt , CRITIC_OPTIM.lt , etc).

### 2. Configuring Juke

Edit the configuration in the UI to set the following values:

- **ToggleKey**: The key you want to use to toggle the bot in-game.  
  Default value: `R`

- **BotType**: For now, leave this as `"GGL_PPO"`.  
  (More types will be supported in the future.)

- **POLICY_SIZE, CRITIC_SIZE, USE_SHARED_HEAD, SHARED_HEAD_SIZE, ObsBuilder, obsSize, hardware, tickSkip, actionDelay**:  
  These values **must match the specifications used to train/export your bot**. Consult the bot's documentation or ask the bot creator for these numbers (or set them accordingly if you own the bot).

- **Port**: The TCP port your bot will listen on. You can set this to 191.

---

## Example Config

```lua
config = {
    ToggleKey: R,
    BotType: GGL_PPO,
    POLICY_SIZE: {1024},
    CRITIC_SIZE: {1024},
    USE_SHARED_HEAD: true,
    SHARED_HEAD_SIZE: {1024, 1024, 1024},
    ObsBuilder: AdvancedObs,
    obsSize: 109,
    hardware: CUDA,
    tickSkip: 8,
    actionDelay: 7,
    Port: 191
}
```

> **Important:** Save this config to a safe location so you do not lose your setup.

---

## Injecting the Bot

1. After transferring your bot files and setting up the config, launch Rocket League.
2. In the Juke interface, click the `"Inject"` button.
3. Wait for the message `"Success"`.
4. You can now toggle your bot in-game using the key you set (default: `R`, unless changed in the config).

---

## Notes

- Double-check every config value for accuracy; failure to match the bot's true specs may prevent it from running correctly.
- Juke is designed for use with bots generated by the GigaLearn framework. Third-party or custom solutions require compatibility.
- Future versions of Juke will support more bot types and additional features.
- This software is designed for educational & research purposes. Any misuse of the software is not to blame on the creator.
